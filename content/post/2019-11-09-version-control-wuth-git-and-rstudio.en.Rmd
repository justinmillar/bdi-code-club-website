## Helpful Resource

### R-centered links

* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) from Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester is a great place to continue from here, with a focus on R, RStudio, and GitHub. 

* [Excuse me, do you have a momment to talk about version control](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) by Jenny Bryan is a great preprint on the utility of Git for reproducible research. 

* [Using version control with Git and SVN](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) by Nathan Stephens is a nice resource, specifically for integrating Git and RStudio. 

* [Git and GitHub](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-pull) chapter from Hadley Wickham's *R packages* book is another great resource that covers more indepth topics (including pull requests).
